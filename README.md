# JAVASCRIPT_LEARNING
A personal log of my JavaScript journey, from basics to real-world problem solving.

# JavaScript Daily Practice

This repository is a **daily log of my JavaScript learning**.  
I use it to build strong fundamentals, improve problem-solving, and gradually move toward writing real-world applications.

Every commit here represents **actual work done on that day**.

## What you will find here

This repo includes:

- Core JavaScript concepts (variables, loops, functions, arrays, objects)
- DOM manipulation and browser interaction
- Events and user input handling
- Logical problems and practice tasks
- Small experiments and mini projects

This is not a polished library — it is a **working notebook** of my growth as a developer.

## Why this repository exists

Most people “learn” JavaScript by watching videos.  
I learn it by **writing code every day**.

This repository helps me:
- Stay consistent
- Track my improvement over time
- Build a public proof of work
